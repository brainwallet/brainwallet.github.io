The concept of decentralized cryptocurrency or decentralized cryptoshare has been flaming for at least six years.

Now I like to write down what you will need when as people uses the 128 shifting for their models.

The generation must be extremely careful as you have to follow the source code to follow up.

Here are some ids which I have found from these purposed cryptos so far For example, BTC,DVC,TRA,PPC,PND and SDC

some crypto is using chainparam instead of writing directly in base58.h,with hard fork chain 

After I have read different versions of crypto, I just have handled very little.

So far, For examples,there are some properties for the purpose, the writing is in DEC so far
BTC,DVC,TRA: 0, Secret is 128 (128 addition found from other cryptos also assume the library used is correct
just need to be careful by studying official sourcecode, official wallet before actually use as some developers 
F*** that up luckily it is not bitcoin, just some not so important coins, and still young with massive amount of space)

Peercoin and Pandacoin (PND) use 55, the privatekey requires to add 128, which loop once more because of range
In numeric method terms, addition arithmetics reduce mistakes.

SDC uses 42


So far, the library the author used,does no wrong so your fund deposited is safe with his code while I just 
add new idenfication codes for different usages.




For more ,It is suggested to leave the zone, go back to the main page of the github by clicking 
the feline on the top left, try to search who has put the sourcecode of crypto


Also For some serious readers, I also have forked the crypto used too.
