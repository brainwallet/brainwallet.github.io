Comments about the tool.
With PGP,then this one,for groupminting or other service,then This will be useful as
The secret exponent is the only thing for control. BitGo and other parties may already know how bad it is. Fortunately,due to great numbers , security suggestions,and the exprity of PGP cert then the information is not easy to be stolen as operators know it's too noticeable when abuse it.

Thank you for providing may be the most defensive tool so people only need to care the 64-hex chars right now.


UPDATED ON 22 APRIL 2015
I have found a way for a PAPER CLAMCOIN wallet. Which is almost KILLED me even get from FREE.
To import, Because CLAMCOIN QT Supports BTC, LTC and DOGE in.

Because according to CLAMCOIN source code, the private key is special while the public is said 137 in decimal, but the private key part is labeled as 3.

I thought I have f**ked the thing up. Or I may be kicked almost cannot walk .

After you have switched to 137 to generate the address required, then you need to switch back to BTC,LTC or DOGE to reshift, You need the exponent to follow up, no exponent needed then means you have lost control of the information regardless the form.



I thought I have lost the control of a clamcoin address. But now I am not afraid and like to work more. The brainwallet is still one of the most robust tool around the world.

CAUTION: Even it is, The wallet follows the 128 shifting rules. If overflowed, from the blue print, it will loop through again.
